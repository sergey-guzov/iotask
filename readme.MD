Implement a program that will receive a directory path as a command line argument, for example "D:/movies". 
Write the folder and file structure to a text file in a form similar to executing the tree /F program.

If the program receives not a directory path as a parameter, but a path to a txt file according to the example above, 
read the file and output the following data to the console: 
- Number of folders
- Number of files
- Average number of files in a folder
- Average length of a file name
